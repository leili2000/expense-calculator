## Personal Expense Calculator
This program was made to help me budget my money by adding purchases to different categories. Most importantly, it splits costs into necessary and personal costs. Right now, it supports 7 categories: "food," "treat," "grocery," "personal," "school," "clothes," and "cash." Any expense can be designated as necessary or personal no matter what category it is in. Writing "n" in an expense designates the whole cost to "necessary," while "sp" splits it 50/50 between necessary and personal. See the template file for examples.

#### Future Plans

 - Users will be able to create categories apart from the 7 listed.
- This program will be remade in Java with a focus on Object Oriented Programming
- The program will create/write to files and store data more efficiently
- A visual interface will be made, so this program won't be dependent on the console
